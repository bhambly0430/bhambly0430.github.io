Today was a fairly successful day.  In the past few hours I was able to get this Jekyll website up and running on [Github](www.github.com) and have started to learn how to use Markdown.  For those of you who may not know about Markdown, it is a "computer language" that allows for easy integration into website (CSS and HTML).  It is to the internet as Latex is to publishable document.  I'm sure that isn't the best description, but I'm no web programmer.

After I setup the website on Github, I setup a domain name through [Namecheap.com](www.namecheap.com).  It was quite cheap.  $0 for 1 year for this .me domain.  The normal cost I believe is $9 per year, but Github and Namecheap offer special pricing for students.
