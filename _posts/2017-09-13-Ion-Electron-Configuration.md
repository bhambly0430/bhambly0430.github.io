  In the next few months, I will begin the journey of preparing to take the medical school entrance exam, MCAT.  This test is more than 6 hours of multiple choice questions on general and organic chemistry, physics, biology, and psychology/sociology.  With degrees in both chemical engineering (B.S.) and biomedical engineering (M.S.) I expect to know most of the material very well already.  However, some of the material will either be new or already forgotten as is the case of electron configurations for ionic species. 
Last week, my wife-to-be and I were at Rhodes College library studying.  As she was preparing for her upcoming optometry part 2 boards exams, I started my preparation for the MCAT.

**General Chemistry: Chapter 1: The Atom**

  I could go into how it feels to read basic concepts in chemistry by someone who works in a chemical sensor laboratory, but I won’t.    Anyone who has taken chemistry, in either college or high school can tell you the basics of writing out electron configurations.  It’s fairly simple once you see the connections between the four different types of orbitals (from the angular momentum quantum number) and the four blocks of the periodic table and the levels of orbitals (from the principal quantum number) and the rows of the periodic table.  
The electron configuration for sodium (Na<sup>0</sup>): 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>1</sup>

Simple, right?  

Now, if you take one electron away to make the sodium cation, Na<sup>+</sup>: 1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>

Easy peasy!

The rule to produce the electron configuration for ionic species is simple:

* __Anions:__ To make an anion you need to add electrons.  Simple write the electron configuration for the next element (for -1 anion) or the one after that (for -2 anion) in the periodic table, e.g. for Cl<sup>-</sup> write the configuration for F<sup>0</sup>. </li>
* __Cations:__ It would seem that you might just write the configuration for the element to the left of the element in question to produce the cation electron configuration, but that would be incorrect.  That is what I thought it would be correct.  The electron to be removed should be removed from the highest energy electron shell.  If your element is in the s- or p-block of the periodic table, our initial method would produce the correct answer.  If your element is in the d- or f-block the result would be incorrect.  The highest energy shell in the d- and f- blocks are NOT the shells be filled as you go across the periodic table.  The highest energy shell when the atom is found in the d- or f- block is the highest principle quantum number s-shell.  So, the electron configuration for Ru<sup>2+</sup> should be [Kr]4d<sup>6</sup> not [Kr]5s<sup>2</sup>4d<sup>4</sup>.</li>

As you can see, writing the electron configuration for ions is straightforward and intuitive once you consider the energy associated with the electrons, not just their position along a particular row in the periodic table.
