Today Sarah and I took a drive to Jonesboro Arkansas to get an idea about the quality of the drive.  For the last few years Sarah has been in Optometry school, and as part of her last year she will have to intern at a few different optometry practices.  At the last minute she had to change one of her practices to Jonesboro, which means she will be making the drive five days a week for a few months.  This trip was half exploratory and half adventure.  

The trip down was dull, which is good for a road trip.  We didn't do too much while in Jonesboro.  Drove by Arkansas State University and stopped in at The Edge coffee and tea shop.  Since we left pretty early Sarah and I decided to forgo breakfast and have something from once we arrived at Jonesboro.  Sarah ordered a bacon, egg and cheddar cheese bagel which was very good.  I ordered the breakfast special which was unlike anything I had ordered before.  

The breakfast special at The Edge was a interesting southern take on eggs Benedict.  The bases was constructed with corn fritter, as they called them, but tasted like good ol fashion unsweetened southern corn bread.  The fritters were topped with bacon, a hard poached egg and a drizzle of avocado hollandaise sauce.  Overall, the special was quite good, but I think I'll try to make it myself sometime.  It'll be better that way!
