A few months ago, I read a book titled _Writing to Learn_ which was kind of a sequel to _On Writing Well_.  The premise of the book centers on using writing as a tool to learn, as you might gather from the title.  Writing about a topic forces you to break down large and complicated concepts into fundamental blocks.  The writing technique described in _Writing to Learn_ should help you reason through and better understand any topic. This was the biggest takeaway for me.  This book is part of the reason I started writing this blog and how I will approach many topics in my education.  The author of the book suggests reading _Reasoning_ by Scriven to help develop reasoning skills which in turn should help in the development of clear writing.  I have seen started reading _Reasoning_ and thought I’d write about some of the important concepts here.

Scriven's book, _Reasoning_, focuses primarily on reasoning as a method to argue, dispute and convince others through verbal and written communication.  Fairly early in the book, Scriven states the seven steps in argument analysis which is the primary means to consider arguments.  The seven steps are as follows:

1. Clarify the meaning of the argument and its components
2. Identify the stated and unstated conclusions
3. Determine the structure of the argument
4. Determine the assumptions (or _premises_)
5. Criticize the assumptions and the flow of logic
6. Consider unstated relevant arguments
7. Evaluate the argument in light of the previous steps

Considering these steps as an argument and analyze them according to the steps themselves I believe would be a productive exercise in understanding.

To analyze an argument _in an effective manner_, should you understand the argument and its components.  I find it difficult to disagree with this point.  For example, it would be impossible to analyze an argument given in a foreign language that you do not understand. 

It would also be impossible to analyze an argument if you are unable to determine the conclusions that are being made.  In some cases, this step is difficult due to others lacking ability to communicate their points and conclusions. This step too is a requirement to analyze an argument. 

I'm going to skip to step 4 and I'll explain why later.  The flow of argument (as I have learned from Scriven) is that conclusions are made from logical statements which are based on assumptions.  These assumptions are the foundation that an argument is built upon.  Understanding the assumptions is an important aspect to analyzing an argument.  

After several discussion (mostly political) with friends and family, I find that differences in opinions are not usually products of logical pathways but are a result of differences of opinion on unstated assumptions.  Economic policy and the various arguments are based on two often unstated assumptions. The assumption can be stated in a question:  Can wealth be created or can it only be acquired by taking it from another person?  I find that most political arguments are a substitute for differences in more fundamental unstated assumption.  

The reason I skipped step 3 is that I believe these steps are out of order.  To determine the structure of an argument, you must first determine all of the components, including the assumption.  The structure is important to understand.  The flow of logic is often where fault can be found which justifies its place on this list.

The 5th step is quite simply the critical step in the analysis process.  Now that you have an understanding of the argument and its layout, you can criticize it for logical fallacy and inconsistencies.  I may write about logical fallacies at a later date.

Further holes in the argument can be found by proposing other possible argument and conclusions based on the stated information.  If by the same arguments presented a second conclusion can be considered valid, then the argument is flawed.  This step requires a great deal of creativity and rationality, as impossible or improbable conclusions do not necessarily disprove the stated conclusion.

Last is to evaluate the overall argument for its quality.  I find that the most difficult part of analyzing any argument is to remove personal bias from the analysis.  This can be difficult if the topic is highly charged as are most political arguments.

This book is a good read, and I highly recommend it.  We deal with argument every day, and actively thinking about how we handle these argumental analyses can help us (me) be better at understanding others arguments.
