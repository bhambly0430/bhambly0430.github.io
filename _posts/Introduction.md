# Hello Everyone!
 
My name is Brad and welcome to my site. 
 
I have attempted to start a blog many times. In fact, you may have realized that the first post on this website was dated 2017. I think my biggest problem was a lack of purpose. I had some general idea of what I wanted to say, and usually, it was focused around some goal or significant life change I wanted to make.  I can't say that this time will be different, but I can say that I have a little more in my life I think is worth sharing. 
 
The goal of this body of work will be to document my experiences as I finish my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering and begin my medical training.  My wife, who is a clinician, and her father, a lawyer, have suggested that I start documenting my experiences.  They say I will meet many interesting people and live extraordinary events that will be worth remembering and documenting.  As a graduate student, I am familiar with the idea of documentation and think this will be a good outlet cope with difficult changes, and I can't say I'm not interested in seeing how I grow over the next several years.
 
So in the fall of 2020, I will have finished defending my Ph.D. and will start medical school.  I applied to begin this fall, 2019, but I was also successful in applying for an international research grant which has permitted me to defer my medical school enrollment for a year. So, this upcoming fall I will be working on my research at Abo Akademi in Turku Finland.  My wife and I are incredibly excited about this opportunity, and I expect to share my experiences here.
 
I think this was enough procrastinating (trying to avoid writing the theory section of a paper), and I will leave it at that.  Hope you have a wonderful day, and until next time.
