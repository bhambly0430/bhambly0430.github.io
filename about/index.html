	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		Hello! My name is Bradley Hambly.  I'm a biomedical engineering PhD student at the University of Memphis and University of Tennessee Health Science Center.  My PhD work focuses on two projects.  Most recently, I have been working on determine the limitations and errors associated with measuring diffusion coefficients of electroactive species in polymeric films using cyclic voltammetry.  For this work I have written an application that simulates voltammograms given a variety of input parameters.  This application can be found on my GitHub page. The second project involves the synthesis of porous hollow polymeric nanocapsules for chemical and biochemical applications.
