	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		Hello! My name is Brad Hambly, and I am currently a biomedical engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Memphis and University of Tennessee Health Science Center.  Aside from my graduate research which branches from nanoparticle synthesis, electrochemical methods, and transport modeling, I immensely enjoy learning new things.  In this site, I hope to chronicle many new and interesting things I have learned, but also remind myself of some of the bits is knowledge I have already forgotten (mostly that stuff you never use ðŸ˜‰).  When Iâ€™m not reading, writing, coding or solving new problems; playing guitar, painting and brewing (beer and wine) occupy my time.
